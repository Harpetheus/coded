        <h4>Living for webdesign</h4>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Brett, a passionate and innovative web designer with an insatiable curiosity for all things design and technology. With a background in fine arts and a full stack web development degree from BCIT, I have honed my skills to craft visually stunning and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impact on visitors.</p>
         <h4>My Journey into Web Design</h4>
         <p>Ever since I laid my eyes on the mesmerizing world of the Internet, I knew I had found my calling. It all began with tinkering around simple HTML and CSS codes, curiously experimenting with layouts, and creating my first website, which was admittedly a bit rough around the edges, but it ignited a flame inside me. That moment marked the beginning of my journey into the ever-evolving realm of web design.</p>
         <h4>My Design Process</h4>
          <p>Collaboration lies at the core of my design process. I firmly believe in open communication with my clients to understand their aspirations, target audience, and unique selling points. By empathizing with their goals, I can transform their ideas into visually captivating realities.</p>
